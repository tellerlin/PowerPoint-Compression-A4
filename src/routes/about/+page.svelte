        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>ByteSlim was born from a simple observation: presentations were getting larger, but sharing them was getting harder. We set out to solve this problem by creating an intuitive tool that anyone could use to optimize their PowerPoint files without compromising quality.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>To provide simple, effective tools that help people share their ideas more efficiently through optimized presentations.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - We believe powerful tools should be easy to use</li>
          <li><strong>Quality</strong> - We never compromise on the quality of your content</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Your files are processed securely and never stored</li>
          <li><strong>Innovation</strong> - We continuously improve our compression technology</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>We're a passionate team of developers and designers working to make file optimization accessible to everyone. Our diverse backgrounds in web development, design, and compression algorithms come together to create ByteSlim.</p>
